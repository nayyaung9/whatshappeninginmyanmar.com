<b>People in Myanmar are reacting with defiance as authorities use night-time raids to arrest opponents of the military coup.</b>

<p>
Video footage showed people banging pots and pans to warn their neighbours of approaching security forces.
<br />
Mass protests have taken place since the military seized control of the South East Asian country on 1 February.
<br />
The army announced on Saturday that arrest warrants had been issued for seven prominent opposition campaigners.
<br />
They are wanted under the rarely used charge of "disturbing tranquillity". One of them, Min Ko Naing, was one of the student leaders involved in the failed 1988 uprising against the then-military dictator. He has appeared in a social media video denouncing the use of night-time raids to make arrests.

The United Nations human rights office said on Friday that more than 350 people had been arrested since the coup.

The country's elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is under house arrest.</p>
