Later that evening, the General Administration Department announced the ban on gatherings and an indefinite 8pm to 4am curfew.  
The department said groups of people had been trying to disrupt public stability, safety and law enforcement, which can cause riots, and that gatherings, giving speeches, and protesting were therefore banned.
